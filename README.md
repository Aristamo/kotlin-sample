# A small sample and applikation with tests for the Kotlin lang

The file `Basics.kt` contains a lot of basic syntax.  

All the other files are a small Joke application written with TDD. 


----

The project uses gradle with a wrapper config.


Run `./gradlew build` to see all warnings and run all Tests. 

The project is created with IntelliJ IDEA. I would recommend to use this IDE.
